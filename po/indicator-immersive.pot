"This is a proof of concept of a new mode for the desktop environment Lomiri "
"wherein some system gestures are disabled to help the user focus on the "
"current app they're using without much distractions."

"This is all it does at the moment but if ever this actually gets into Lomiri "
"officially, maybe some other gestures can also be disabled such as the 3-"
"finger gestures in tablets."
